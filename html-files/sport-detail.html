They kind of helped us; they calmed us down. My brother - I've never seen someone in such shock. He was so pale, he couldn't speak and I still don't know what he saw because we have never spoken about it. <br><br> "One of the Forest fans was a dad with a couple of kids - you think now, those poor, young kids, what they saw."</p>
